This is a number of helper tools to maintain the openSUSE Tumbleweed
project.

It contains some informational files detailing where the different
projects come from (i.e. where they are linked from) and some scripts to
help update and maintain the distro over time.

For more details about what openSUSE Tumbleweed is, please see:
	http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-project/2010-11/msg00206.html
for the original project announcement.

It can be used today by taking an openSUSE 11.3 release and adding the
openSUSE:Tumbleweed repository to the list of repositories to pull from
and then doing 'zypper dup' to update to the latest version of the
packages.

WARNING!!!!

 At this point in time, the Tumbleweed repository is under heavy
 development and is only recommended for people who are comfortable
 handling different repositories on their openSUSE install and can
 roll packages back if problems happen.  By the time openSUSE 11.4 comes
 out, this should all be worked out and in much better shape.  I
 recommend coming back then unless you are very daring.
