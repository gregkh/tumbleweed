# This is a list of the source of the packages that are links in the
# openSUSE:Tumbleweed repo.
#
# The check_packages script takes this list and runs it through the
# 'check_package' script to see if the link is up to date or not.

# Lines starting with a '#' are ignored, as is whitespace.

#
# Kernel
#
# The kernel package has one main package:
Kernel:stable/kernel-source
# Then the rest of the kernel packages are just links to that one in
# order to handle the multiple parts of it.  This means the following
# list of packages should not be touched at all, they get automatically
# generated:
#
# kernel-debug
# kernel-default
# kernel-desktop
# kernel-docs
# kernel-ec2
# kernel-pae
# kernel-syms
# kernel-trace
# kernel-vanilla
# kernel-vmi
# kernel-xen

Kernel:stable/kernel-firmware
Kernel:stable/preload
# preload wants a new systemtap and elfutils package as well:
Kernel:stable/systemtap
